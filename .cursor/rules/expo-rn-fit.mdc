Project uses Expo framework.

Use current packages from package json if possible. Ask if you need to add other packages.

Don't provide fontSize into styles. Use ThemedText for all texts. Text itself should be created with internationalization. If you need a string - create it in i18n.ts and then use it in code.

For charts use victory-native. For examples on victory native use victory-native-xl repository.
