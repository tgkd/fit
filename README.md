## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

2. Install iOS pods (if developing for iOS)

   ```bash
   npx pod-install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

   Or open the project in Xcode and run it from there.

   You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
